# variable = properties with varying values 
# variables can be quantities or qualities (categorical)
# how much vs. what / how

# take team as example categorical variable
# can tell if two individuals are different
# can't tell size / direction of difference
# this is unlike a quantitative variable

# scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interal, ratio
# key questions: is there difference, what's the direction, how much is it?

# nominal = can tell whether they're different but don't know size or direction
nominal_scale = sorted(['Name', 'Team', 'Pos', 'Birth_Place', 'College'])

# ordinal = can tell whether they're different and direction, but not size (often ranks or scales)
# numerical = measured on a scale that preserves order btw values
# sometimes size is measured in real numbers, sometimes uses interval / ratio scale
# most common interval / ratio scales = height, weight, time, price
# zero is where interval vs ratio scale differ
# 	0 for interval is not actually a value of significance so can't use ratios
#	0 for ratio is true zero / absence of value, so can use ratios to show diff

# interval scales less common but two examples are dates and temperatures

# discrete variables vs. continuous (determined by underlying nature of var)
# important to separate out measurement precision (eg height)
# every value of continuous variable is interval regardless of precision
