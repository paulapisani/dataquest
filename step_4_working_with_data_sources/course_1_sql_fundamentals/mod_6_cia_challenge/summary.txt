- Can look through log of sqlite tables from connection
- E.g. select * from sqlite_master where type='table'
- When working in Jupyter, can use pandas to read SQL query results directly into df
- E.g. pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
- Pandas vs. SQLite can be tough call
- Most data anlaysts / data scientists use SQL based GUI
- This allows you to write / save queries, run against multiple dbs, return results as table, and visualize
